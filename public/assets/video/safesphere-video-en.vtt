00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.690
We live in a world defined by time, space, and distance.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.919
A safe environment where we all live together should be within our reach.

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.339
Today, thanks to a major collaborative effort between

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.980
business leaders, medical professionals, engineers, and scientists,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.359
there is a new, accurate, and inexpensive way to ensure a safe space in your daily activities,

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.480
on your mobile device.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.779
SafeSphere is the first technology using mobile devices

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.470
to identify how close we are to each other

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.280
reducing risk and exposure to businesses and their customers.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.830
Using precise acoustic signals, SafeSphere's proprietary technology

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.800
accurately determines your proximity to others

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.890
and alerts you to keep the safe distance you define.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.120
SafeSphere easily integrates with existing mobile apps,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.010
to help create a safer environment

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.740
with minimal costs and physical changes to your facilities.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.900
SafeSphere was designed from the ground up to help keep everyone safe:

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.740
employees,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.199
customers,

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.300
students,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.600
patients,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.010
as well as families and friends.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.800
SafeSphere lets smartphones monitor distance between users to keep us safer when:

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.500
studying,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.800
working,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.880
dining,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.000
shopping,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.900
traveling,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.200
playing,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.500
staying active,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.000
enjoying the outdoors.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.700
SafeSphere brings the world closer

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.540
but not too close.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.200
Have a question?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.539
